# JCE (Java Cryptography Extensions) Examples

Example code / tests for
* **Symmetric encryption** with generated keys and password-base keys (PBE key derivation)
* **Asymmetric encryption** with _RSA_ 
* **Signing/verification** with _RSA_ and _EC
* **HMAC** example
* **Key Agreement** with _ephemeral ECDH_ for forward secrecy

Example code for
* Checking presence of **Unlimited Strenght Cryptography**
* Listing all available **JCE algorithms** by type
* Listing all supported, default and recommended **Cipher Suites** for TLS
